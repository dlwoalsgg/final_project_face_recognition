I used to work in a cancer research laboratory.

My best friend was diagnosed with skin cancer and had bad allergic reaction to most of cosmetics.

unbelievably I could not find a product on the market to help her.

Most products would irritate and worsen her condition, causing excessive irritation.

I started developing customized treatment for her.
